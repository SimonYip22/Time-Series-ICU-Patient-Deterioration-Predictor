    # 5-Fold Cross-Validation Setup
    # -----------------------------
    # KFold splits the dataset into N_FOLDS=5 groups (folds).
    # n_splits = number of folds → how many groups the dataset is split into.
    # shuffle=True randomises the patient order before splitting to reduce bias.
    # random_state=42 ensures reproducibility (you get the same splits every time).
    kf = KFold(n_splits=N_FOLDS, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
    # KFold does stratified rotation: each patient is assigned to exactly one fold, so no patient is ever skipped.
    # Over the 5 folds, each patient will be in the test set once and in the training set 4 times.
    
    fold_idx = 1
    # Loop over each fold (5)
    # kf.split(X) returns row indices for training (train_index) and test sets (text_index) for each fold.
    # The first variable (train_index) is assigned all the rows that are not in the current fold.
    # The second variable (test_index) is assigned the rows in the current fold.
    # Each iteration of the loop returns train_index (training indices of rows) and test_index (testing indices of rows)
    for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
        # .iloc[train_index] / .iloc[test_index] selects the actual rows for X and y from DataFrame according to the indices KFold generated.
        # So the X feature columns and y target column each get both the training index of patients (4 indices), and the test index of patients (1 index)
        X_train, X_test = X.iloc[train_index], X.iloc[test_index]
        y_train, y_test = y.iloc[train_index], y.iloc[test_index]
